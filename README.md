### Configure your analytics widgets

Follow the steps in the Google Identity Platform documentation to [create a service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount) from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

Once the service account is created, you can click the Generate New JSON Key button to create and download the key and add it to your project.

Add the service account as a user in Google Analytics. The service account you created in the previous step has an email address that you can add to any of the Google Analytics views you'd like to request data from. It's generally best to only grant the service account read-only access.

Then you will need to configure __otto\_admin__ with the json path and the view ID (continue reading).
